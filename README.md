# GrinBreak
##### Positive, Uplifting, Motivational

THE GOAL: To provide a destintation where the content on the site warms your heart or brings a smile to your face. 

METHOD: The idea is to restrict content to that which only has a positive or uplifiting 'flare' to it.

Basically, this project is designed to be a destination for our global society to break from all the sadness, hatred, and negativity that
<i> unfortunately </i> constantly surrounds us.

RULES: On the onset, the design of the site is to behave like a ProductHunt or Reddit style community. There will be a section where the Top 5
posts of the day are tracked (and independently displayed). Additionally, there will be categories and/or tagging (# tags) that enable
searching or filtering to specific topics. E.g., #music, #gif, #basketball, #inspirational, etc.
